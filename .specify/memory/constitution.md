# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI/Spec-Driven Development
All content creation and feature development must follow AI-native spec-driven methodology using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code; Every component must be testable and verifiable through specifications; Content generation must be reproducible and maintainable

### Docusaurus Framework Compliance
All website functionality must be built using Docusaurus framework; All components must be reusable and follow TypeScript strict mode; Mobile-first responsive design with glassmorphism + gradient UI

### RAG Chatbot Integration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Integrated RAG Chatbot must be implemented using ChatKit/FastAPI/Neon Postgres/Qdrant; Chatbot must answer questions based on the entire book content and user-selected text; Implementation must follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle

### Modular Architecture
Content must adhere to the 4 modules and 13 weekly breakdown topics structure; All components must be reusable and follow the course architecture; Each module must be independently testable and deployable

### Authentication and Personalization
Better-Auth integration must be implemented for user signup/signin; User background collection required for personalization; Personalization features must be available for logged-in users

### Deployment and Standards
All deployments must target GitHub Pages or Vercel; Strict TypeScript mode must be enforced throughout the project; Only shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS libraries allowed for UI components

## Technical Constraints
Framework: Docusaurus only
UI Libraries: shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS only
Design: Mobile-First, glassmorphism + gradient design
Standards: TypeScript strict mode
Output: All components must be reusable
Deployment: GitHub Pages or Vercel only
Content Source: Course Details (Quarter Overview, 4 Modules, Weekly Breakdown, Assessments, Hardware Requirements, VLA, ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac)

## Development Workflow
Content creation must follow the 4 modules and 13 weekly breakdown topics
AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
Reusable Intelligence through Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills
All components must be testable and verifiable
Code reviews must verify compliance with all principles

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation and approval; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with principles; All content must align with target audience of students and professionals applying AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots; Complexity must be justified with clear rationale; Use project templates for runtime development guidance
